## HOW THE WEB WORKS.
    Client, so the browser sends a request to the server, server reaches out to a database, works with files - sends back a response(html or smth different) - and sends it back to the client, the browser which then displays the response.

## Nodejs runs on the server.
    The event-loop is a concept in nodejs that...
    Core modules can be imported and used in any files - import via require('module)

    NB: The createServer() event never finished by default.
